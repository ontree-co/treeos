# Welcome to TreeOS

TreeOS is server software for your home lab or your office—it puts AI on your site, both literally on your infrastructure and figuratively at your side. Builders get a single place to run their services and the models that power them, all from the browser without touching the command line. We think a [Framework Desktop](https://frame.work/de/en/desktop)—or any similarly capable box—is the perfect home for it.

## What is TreeOS?

TreeOS is a platform for shipping containers alongside local LLMs:

- **🚀 One-Click Deployments** – Launch production-ready stacks from polished templates or remix them into your own projects.
- **🎛️ Polished Interface** – A cohesive web dashboard for editing Compose files, streaming logs, and managing environments directly in the browser.
- **🧠 Model-Native Platform** – Treat models as first-class citizens. Pull curated chat, code, and vision models, watch download progress live, and plug them straight into your apps.
- **🛠️ Built for Builders** – Tailored to people who want to bring their own code, keep data on their hardware, and iterate quickly.
- **⚙️ Optimized for AMD AI 300 Series** – Designed to leverage modern APUs with up to 128 GB of RAM so local inference and application hosting share the same machine gracefully.

## Why TreeOS?

### Ship Faster
Paste a compose file, add env vars, and TreeOS scaffolds the project. The platform keeps containers in sync, restarts them after edits, and logs every action so you always know what changed.

### Run Models Locally
Pick from the curated catalog or add your own models. TreeOS keeps them ready on disk, tracks installation state, and integrates them with apps that expect locally served inference.

### Operate with Confidence
Real-time metrics for CPU, GPU, memory, disk, and network are streamed into the dashboard with historical sparklines. Built-in security checks guard mounts, capabilities, and privilege levels before containers start.

## Getting Started

Install the binary, run TreeOS on your hardware, and open the dashboard. Deploy a template or import your own project to see how one-click operations, local models, and observability come together.
